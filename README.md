# Profile Generator
This project will generate a team profile web page based on command line input from a user. It will collect information about the
user role, name, email, and dependingn on the role office number or school for managers and interns respectively. Once all of the data is collected it will generate the team_output.html and open it for the user to review.

# Testing
In order to get more comfortable with unit testing, I utilized the Jest NPM package and followed the examples from the class work and
instructions I found on YouTube in the Web Dev Simplified channel. This helped me understand the value of testing and how it can be applied
to my future projects.
